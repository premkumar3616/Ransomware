# System Breach Simulator (Horror Prank App)

This is a mobile-optimized horror prank application.

## How to use as a "Stuck" Mobile App:

1. **Host on GitHub Pages**:
   - Upload all files to a GitHub repository.
   - Enable GitHub Pages in Settings.
   
2. **Install on Phone**:
   - Open your GitHub Pages URL in Safari (iOS) or Chrome (Android).
   - iOS: Tap the **Share** button -> **Add to Home Screen**.
   - Android: Tap the **Three Dots** -> **Install App** or **Add to Home Screen**.

3. **Launch**:
   - Open the app from your home screen. It will launch in full-screen mode without any browser bars, effectively "locking" the user in until they enter the secret phrase.

**Secret Key:** `job holder`
